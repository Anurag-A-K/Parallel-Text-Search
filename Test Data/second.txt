The Americas (also collectively called America;[4][5] Dutch: Amerika, French: Amérique, Portuguese and Spanish: América) comprise the totality of the continents of North and South America.[6][7][8] Together, they make up most of the land in Earth's Western Hemisphere and comprise the New World.[4]

Along with their associated islands, they cover 8% of Earth's total surface area and 28.4% of its land area. The topography is dominated by the American Cordillera, a long chain of mountains that runs the length of the west coast. The flatter eastern side of the Americas is dominated by large river basins, such as the Amazon, St. Lawrence River / Great Lakes basin, Mississippi, and La Plata. Since the Americas extend 14,000 km (8,700 mi) from north to south, the climate and ecology vary widely, from the arctic tundra of Northern Canada, Greenland, and Alaska, to the tropical rain forests in Central America and South America.
