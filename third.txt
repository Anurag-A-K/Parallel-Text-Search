The oldest dated rocks formed on Earth, as an aggregate of minerals that have not been subsequently broken down by erosion or melted, are more than 4 billion years old, formed during the Hadean Eon of Earth's geological history. Meteorites that were formed in other solar systems can pre-date the Earth. Particles from the Murchison meteorite were dated in January 2020 to be 7 billion years old.
